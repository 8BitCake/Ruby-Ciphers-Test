Hello! Welcome to my ciphers repository.

I'm a programming n00b and well these are just random projects I decided to work on to learn Ruby.
I actually ran into the caesar cipher while watching a Web3 Foundtion video and couldn't get it to work so I learned Ruby to get it to work.

Still working on badhash. Feel free to help. Adding license because some rando on the internet says it's good form.
